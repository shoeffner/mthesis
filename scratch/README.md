This directory contains materials I created during the process of writing the
thesis and the gaze library. It might be interesting for you, but more likely
it is just random stuff like scripts used to create graphics, test scripts
and reference implementations.


## Active

These files are used for the final thesis.

- [Test face images: Downloads, conversions and annotations](pexels_face_images)
- [Facebase dataset download](facebase_data)
- [Visual comparison between EPNP and ITERATIVE algorithms of OpenCV's solvePnP](solvePnPcomparison)
- [A reference MWE to get GazeCapture's model working in caffe.](caffe-test)


## Outdated

These files were useful to get things started but most likely lack behind the
current state of implementation. I kept them for now for reference if needed.

- [Eye center localization play ground](eye_center)
- [Head model tests](head_models)
- [OpenCV Test](OpenCVTest)
- [A presentation and the original abstract draft](related_materials)
