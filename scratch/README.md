This directory contains materials I created during the process of writing the
thesis and the gaze library. It might be interesting for you, but more likely
it is just random stuff like scripts used to create graphics, test scripts
and reference implementations.

# "Projects"

## Active

These files are still in use in their current state.

- [Test face images: Downloads, conversions and annotations](pexels_face_images)
- [Facebase dataset download](facebase_data)
- [OpenCV Test](OpenCVTest)

## Outdated

These files were useful to get things started but most likely lack behind the
current state of implementation. I kept them for now for reference if needed.

- [Eye center localization play ground](eye_center)
- [Head model tests](head_models)
