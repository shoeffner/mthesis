The images in 'resized' have been downloaded from Pexels.com using the tools in
https://github.com/shoeffner/mthesis/tree/master/scratch/pexels_face_images.
They have been resized and their pupils have been annotated (annotations match
the resized images). To download the original files, please use the tools provided
at the URL above.

The annotations contain two rows, each corresponding to an x, y tuple of pixel
coordinates. If both of them are 0, no pupil was annotated.

For example, 0000.csv contains:

    255, 187 348, 187

This means the right pupil in resized/0000.jpeg is at (255, 187) and the left
pupil at (348, 187).
