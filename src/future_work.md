# Future work

## Possible fixes

- model
  - eye model as sphere or ellipsoid
  - calibration


## Possible extensions

- program
  - writers, readers
  - flexible camera position
- program architecture
  - plugin system
  - configuration flaws

- tests?
- eye models from papers
- writers/readers
- real applications
- learn ML model
- settle on either dlib or OpenCV by using custom models/algorithms for the other
