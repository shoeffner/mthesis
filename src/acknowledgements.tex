I would like to thank Prof. Heidemann and Julius Schöning for supervising this
thesis, for giving me useful remarks about the topic, and encouraging me to
follow my ideas. Many thanks to Andrea Suckro, for her invaluable support
consisting of hours of debugging, proofreading, general life counseling, and
all other issues which came up during the thesis. I am also very grateful to
Carolin Gaß, who helped me a lot with her insightful comments and remarks on
the text. To all my friends and family, I would also like to say thanks for
their continuous aid.
