Eye and gaze tracking have long been methods to study human attention. Many
devices for gaze tracking are expensive, and software is often also only
available for high license fees (there are exceptions). For many gaze tracking
setups it is even mandatory to use multiple computers, for showing stimuli and
for tracking gaze, respectively.

Today, modern laptops are equipped with enough processing power to process a
video stream live. Additionally many laptops come with a built-in webcam for
tele conferencing and video chats. In this thesis the possibilities of
performing gaze tracking using a calibration free, model based approach on
laptops using built-in webcams will be explored.

While the attempt to track gaze fails, eye tracking proves to be very reliable
and robust. The thesis will discuss possible improvements of the model and how
traditional calibration methods might solve the problems connected with gaze
tracking.
