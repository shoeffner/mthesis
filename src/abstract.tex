Eye and gaze tracking have long been methods to study visual attention. Many
devices for gaze tracking are expensive and require specific setup and
calibration procedures. For many gaze tracking setups, it is even mandatory to
use multiple computers, for showing stimuli and for tracking gaze,
respectively.

Today, modern laptops are equipped with enough processing power to process a
video stream live. Additionally, many laptops come with a built-in webcam for
teleconferencing and video chats. In this thesis, the possibility of
performing gaze tracking using a calibration free, feature-based approach on
laptops using built-in webcams is explored. To try the model, the free and
open source software library \Gaze{} is implemented and evaluated.

It is shown that \Gaze{} reaches very good eye tracking capabilities and
manages to be easily usable and extendable. Its gaze tracking abilities are
still to be improved, but because of its modular structure existing solutions
like pre-trained neural networks can be integrated to leverage their strengths.
