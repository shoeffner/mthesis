# General

This repository mixes together files from various sources under various
licenses. This file shall clear up which things are released how and under
which terms to make it transparent which files can be used how.


## Thesis text

The materials inside the [src](src) directory are the text of my thesis and
thus fall under certain copyrights, but also under the limitations and exceptions to copyright.
Thus, don't plagiarize my thesis, but read it, cite it, criticize it, print it,
... but don't copy it word by word and claim it to be your own.


## CSL files

The csl files in [assets](assets) are released under CC BY-SA 3.0.
The csl file springer-socpsych-author-date.mod.csl is a modified version of the
original springer-socpsych-author-date.csl.


## Submodules

All submodules are subject to their respective licenses.
- Gaze is released under the MIT License.
- GazeCapture is released under a special research only license.


## Images from pexels.com

Pexels releases all its images under a CC0 license.


## Data from facebase

While no data is inside the repository, there are scripts to download data from
facebase. Be kind and don't download the data too often and respect their
licenses and citation rules when you use the data.


## Other images

- [assets/images/pattern.png](assets/pattern.png) is taken from the OpenCV
  library and is there released under the BSD License (see below).
- [assets/images/huey_eyetracker.png](assets/images/huey_eyetracker.png) is
  taken from a copy of an old book, scanned by the google book project. It is
  released into the Public Domain.
- [scratch/caffe-test/images](scratch/caffe-test/images) are not released to be
  used for anything but verification of the presented approachtes in
  [scratch/caffe-test](scratch/caffe-test). This will change once I provide
  proper images.


## Other materials

The files in [scratch/related_materials](scratch/related_materials) fall into
the same category as the thesis and are protected by normal copyrights.
However, feel free to use and modify the presentation to your liking.

I release all other materials in this repository, except otherwise noted under
the MIT License (see below), especially
- [scratch](scratch) (except related_materials, see above)
- [bin](bin)
- the files in the root directory
- [assets/examples](assets/examples), [assets/gen_figures](assets/gen_figures)
- [assets](assets) (except some images and the csl files, see above).
