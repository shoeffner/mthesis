# Assets

This directory include several assets which had no better place to go but are
important for the thesis compilation.

- [chapters.list](chapters.list): Contains the chapter order.
- [bibliography.bib](bibliography.bib): Contains the bibliography, managed
  using [JabRef](http://www.jabref.org/).
- \*.csl: Citation style language files. Only one will be used, but I might add
  multiple one to decide later.
- [glossary.tex](glossary.tex): The glossary file.
- [thesistitlepage.sty](thesistitlepage.sty): Titlepage and declaration of authorship definitions.
- [examples](examples): Code examples to be used throughout the thesis.
